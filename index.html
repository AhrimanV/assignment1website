      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Athletes are the foundation of every successful training program. The best coach is an experienced guide who begins with each athlete's hopes, dreams and desires and then tailors a training plan based on that individuals’s current fitness and lifestyle. Since 2012, GEC has helped hundreds of individuals achieve success in many fitness areas. The winner is not the one who finishes first but anyone who starts the race and perseveres. Join us and begin exploring the possible.
